"""
Generate AI-curated release notes for a new Lagoon release.

Usage:
    python3 .github/scripts/release_notes.py <prev_tag_or_empty> <version>

Reads commit log + file stats between <prev_tag> and HEAD, asks Claude to
produce structured markdown release notes, and prints them to stdout.

Reads ANTHROPIC_API_KEY from the environment.

Exits non-zero on any failure so the workflow can fall back to a plain
git-log changelog without breaking the release.

PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """You are writing release notes for a VS Code color theme called Lagoon.

Lagoon is a warm-teal color theme with a light counterpart (Lagoon Light). Syntax colors are assigned by frequency and adjacency — high-frequency tokens get high-contrast colors, adjacent token kinds get distinct hues, and HTML / Java / TypeScript get specific separation rules. The two theme JSON files live at themes/lagoon-dark-color-theme.json and themes/lagoon-light-color-theme.json.

Generate concise, well-structured release notes for version {version}, based on the commits and changed files below.

Rules:
- Group changes into sections with emoji headers — only include sections that have actual changes. Pick from: 🎨 Palette / Colors, ✨ New, 🐛 Fixes, 📝 Documentation, 🔧 CI / Tooling, ♻️ Refactor.
- Each bullet should explain WHAT changed and WHY it matters to the user — 1-2 sentences. Don't just restate the commit message verbatim. For color/palette tweaks, mention which token or UI surface and why (readability, contrast, vibe).
- Skip trivial commits (typo fixes, lockfile bumps, formatting-only) unless they're meaningful.
- Always skip the `chore: release vX.Y.Z` commit — that's the automated version bump and contains no real changes.
- Do NOT invent metrics, numbers, or rationale that aren't visible in the commit log or diff stats. If a commit doesn't explain why, write a plausible user-facing impact based on the file paths involved (e.g. themes/lagoon-dark-color-theme.json → dark theme tweak; themes/lagoon-light-color-theme.json → light theme tweak; icon.png → marketplace icon change).
- Start the output directly with the first section header. No preamble like "This release..." or "Hello!".
- Do NOT include an Install section — the workflow prepends one automatically.

Commits since {prev_tag_label}:
